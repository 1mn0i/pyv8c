# Documentation Index

[简体中文](../README.md) | **English**

This collection describes the current implementation and interface contracts. Complete the [project installation](README.en.md#installation) before reading the examples. Commands run from the repository root by default. `pyv8/` is now a build-support directory rather than a separately installable package; the articles under `docs/pyv8/` describe the embedded V8 native layer, and some paths and build commands still follow the former package layout. Check those against the current source and the [development guide](pyv8c/development.md).

Topic files use lowercase English words and hyphens, and the index keeps the name `README.md`. The Chinese collection is the primary version; this English collection mirrors its paths under `docs/en/`. Python, JavaScript, protocol and configuration names keep their real spelling. The four `pyv8/` articles (`architecture`, `bridge-kernel`, `bridge-refactor-results`, `source-layout`) were originally drafted in English; the Chinese collection now carries complete Chinese translations, and this English collection keeps the original English wording.

These documents do not replace source code or tests. When investigating a difference, record the interpreter, native extension, IDL, environment profile, local Chrome and network transport versions together, and do not treat them as one version number.

For the concrete implementation and its limits, see [Web Capabilities and Coverage](pyv8c/web-capabilities.md).
