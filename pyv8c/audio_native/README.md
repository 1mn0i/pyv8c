# Native audio wave tables

The `_audio_native` Python extension generates the Chromium 157 FFT wave tables
on first use. The result is cached in memory; the old waveform ZIP is not needed
at runtime and is not included in wheels. It also renders supported constant
x86 oscillators in batches. Batch and single-sample rendering share the same
native phase and FFT interpolation code. Waveforms outside that FFT path,
including custom periodic waves, use their respective waveform implementations.

To build the extension in a source checkout, install Rust (2024 edition) and run:

```console
python -m pip install "setuptools>=77" "setuptools-rust>=1.10,<2" wheel
python setup.py build_rust --release --inplace
```

Normal wheel builds also build this extension. Cargo.lock pins the Rust
dependencies. The generated values depend on the FFT implementation and target
architecture; compare against the intended Chromium version and platform after
changing those inputs. The audio graph is managed in Python; dynamics
compression runs in Rust with state shared by single-sample and block calls.

## Remaining performance work

The direct constant-oscillator-to-compressor graph is rendered in a native
block. Other graphs retain sample-by-sample graph scheduling while using the
same native compressor state. Batching additional graph types requires preserving
node ordering, automation, phase, and compressor state, and comparing the result
with Chrome's float32 output.
